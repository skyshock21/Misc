# Output Random IP address

RandIP.py allows you to output a random IP address in either IPv4 or IPv6 format.  It can serve as a library to be imported as well.  

## Run Application

In the directory where the script is stored run

```
python rand_ip.py
```

By default it will output an IPv4 address, and the flag -v4 will also output an IPv4 address.  If you want an IPv6 address, type

```
python rand_ip.py -v6
```

If running properly you should see a random IP address returned in the format you specified.
